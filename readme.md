The Wyvern project
==================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wyvernlang/wyvern.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/wyvernlang/wyvern)

Wyvern is a new general-purpose programming language designed to support adaptation and assurance.  Key features of Wyvern's evolving design include:

* A simple object model with good support for both object-oriented and functional programming
* Static type safety
* Extensibility with domain-specific syntax via libraries written within the language
* A simple but powerful capability-safe module system
* Support for various aspects of software architecture within the running system

The best starting point for understanding Wyvern is the Wyvern manifesto: 
[Wyvern: A Language for Usable Design-Driven Assurance](https://github.com/wyvernlang/wyvern/wiki/Wyvern%3A-A-Language-for-Usable-Design-Driven-Assurance)

For an introduction to key concepts of the Wyvern language, see https://github.com/wyvernlang/docs/raw/master/guide/wyvern-guide.pdf

For information about how to build and run the Wyvern tools, and about the Wyvern tools architecture, see https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wyvernlang/docs/master/tooldoc/wyvern-tool-architecture.mdk


Research papers on Wyvern and other material is available at the Wyvern web page, http://wyvernlang.github.io/
